INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING ON LOCAL MACHINE
============================================

You need to input both forum files to your Hadoop job. Instead of supplying the filename when running the job, upload both forum files to a directory in HDFS and provide that directory to the script as the input source.

Remember to add the #!/usr/bin/python line in your mapper and reducer.
